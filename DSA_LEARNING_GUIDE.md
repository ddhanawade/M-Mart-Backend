- Use Pomodoro technique (25-min focused sessions)
- Take regular breaks
- Review previous topics weekly
- Track progress consistently
```

### **When You Get Stuck:**
```java
// Problem-solving when stuck:
1. Take a break and come back fresh
2. Try explaining the problem to someone else
3. Look for similar solved problems
4. Break down the problem into smaller parts
5. Draw the problem visually
6. Consider different data structures/approaches
